         Hey there! Thank you for visiting my site and opening up the dev tools!
         If you think there's anything wrong with the code that's in here please let me know! I'm open to feedback.
         I hope you find my website interesting - I worked hard on it!     
         
         Oh, and you may or may not be wondering - why rockets? 
         But I settled on rockets and space, because I really like space things. A picture of a black hole was 
         recently taken, and that sparked my interest in decorating my website with space things.

      Oh, you're still here?  
      To be completely honest, the website initially had a submarine theme going on.  
      Don't really know why. I'm very glad I stuck with the space theme.
